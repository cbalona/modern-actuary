Hello, I'm Caesar Balona. This is my personal journal where I collect thoughts
and ideas around modernising the actuarial toolkit and anything else I find
interesting. I am generally curious about things and enjoy learning.

I currently work at Old Mutual Insure building an industry leading climate and
catastrophe modelling platform and fulfilling the role of Head of the Actuarial
Function (HAF) for one of our subsidiaries.
