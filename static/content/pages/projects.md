The app allows users to place objects within a virtual house and observe how a fire might spread under various conditions. It was developed as an entry into the 2023 Hacktuary Challenge, a competition organized by the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) to encourage the development of applications that utilise actuarial concepts to solve pressing risk management problems related to property insurance."

It is designed to be modular, fast and easy to use. Leveraging the power of Dask, it can perform parallel and distributed computation to allow for large scale reinsurance computation. It is still in very early development."

A selection of some projects I have worked on over the years.

## [InsuranceAutomata 🔥](https://insurance-automata.com/)

InsuranceAutomata is an interactive application that simulates the spread of fire across a house using a cellular automata model. The app allows users to place objects within a virtual house and observe how a fire might spread under various conditions. It was developed as an entry into the 2023 Hacktuary Challenge, a competition organized by the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) to encourage the development of applications that utilize actuarial concepts to solve pressing risk management problems related to property insurance.

## [Reinsurance](https://github.com/cbalona/reinsurance)

Reinsurance is a python package that intends to provide a framework for reinsurance computation. It is built on top of NumPy and Dask. It is designed to be modular, fast and easy to use. Leveraging the power of Dask, it can perform parallel and distributed computation to allow for large scale reinsurance computation. It is still in very early development.

## [RiskyRouter](https://github.com/casact/risky-router)

RiskyRouter.com is a website I built as an entry into the 2022 CAS Hacktuary competition. It was selected as a joint winner.
